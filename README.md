## The Exercise

Josefine is living on a very long street with houses numbered from 111 to 10910^9109. Unlike on a normal street, all houses are located on the same side of the street.

Every year at Christmas, Josefine is responsible for putting up a beautiful light chain on her street. Obviously she wants the light chain to be as long as possible. Unfortunately, not all the families on the street want to be a part of the light chain decoration. Therefore she asks all families on her street to put a letter with their house number in her mailbox if they want to participate.

When she has collected the letters, she wants to find the longest consecutive sequence of house numbers that want to participate in the decoration. Help Josefine write a program that given the house numbers on the letters can determine the length of the longest possible light chain (measured in the number of consecutive houses).

### Input format
First line: An integer N, denoting the number of letters she received (1≤N≤5⋅10^5).  
Second line: N space separated integers corresponding to the house numbers in the letters.

### Output format
First line: The length of the longest possible light chain.

### Example
#### Input

10
7 101 999 100 8 99 45 102 6 97

#### Output

4

#### Explanation

The longest possible light chain is between houses 99, 100, 101, 102.
